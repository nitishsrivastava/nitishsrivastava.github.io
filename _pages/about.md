I am working on building the nervous system for autonomous mobile robots at [Vayu Robotics](https://www.vayurobotics.com).
I was an ML researcher at Apple, working on representation learning for embodied agents.
I was a PhD student in the Machine Learning Group at the University of Toronto, working with Geoffrey Hinton and Ruslan Salakhutdinov.
I obtained my Bachelor's in Computer Science from IIT Kanpur, India in May 2011.
